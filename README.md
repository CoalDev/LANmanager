# LANmanager
a LAN system manager with options for reverse shell, screenshot, record audio, keylog. ```(version 0.0.5).```
##### A project I made in 11th grade for my home network and my school network so the teacher can connect to any computer and take screenshots/do commands on the computer

### How to run:
#### On host
 - go to ```host->dist``` and double click on host.exe
#### On client
 - go to ```client->dist``` and double click on parasite.exe
### Options As the client:
 - you can connect to the computer via a command line interface with the private IP of the computer and the default port which is 12345
 - you can get a screenshot from one of the computers who has the host.exe file with the private IP of the computer and the default port which is 12345
 - you can get a recording of the microphone while there is some noise from one of the computers who has the host.exe file with the private IP of the computer and the default port which is 12345
 - in this ```version (0.0.5)``` you can't keylog, it will come soon though
